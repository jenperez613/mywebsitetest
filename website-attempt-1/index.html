      <h2>Pacman Frogs</h2>
      <h3>December 2021</h3>
      <strong class="opening-line">My favorite things right now are pacman frogs.</strong>
      <p>There are several kinds of pacman frogs, most from South America. My frog, named Frodo, is Argentinian. These frogs spend all day burrowed underneath the fallen leaves of the tropical forests. As ambush predators, they hunt by sitting very still and waiting for food to come to them. Overall, they live a relatively mundane life, moving infrequently and eating anything that fits in their mouth.</p>

      <p>South American horned frogs have a pretty frumpy body shape. Their extremely round bodies and large mouths have earned them the nickname “Pac-Man frogs,” due to their resemblance to the video game character of the same name. This stocky body type actually works perfectly for their hunting style. Rather than needing a long, lean body to climb and track down food like some frogs, these guys just partially bury themselves in the dirt and lazily wait for something to walk in front of their face. When suitable prey is near enough, the frog’s super-sticky tongue darts out to quickly ensnare it.</p>
      <p>While the use of a sticky tongue has been working for amphibians and reptiles for millions of years, researchers didn’t really know much about the adhesive performance or the amount of force exerted onto the prey until Thomas Kleinteich and Stanislav Gorb of Christian Albrecht University in Kiel, Germany decided to investigate. Their results were published in an open-access format in <em>Scientific Reports.</em></p>
